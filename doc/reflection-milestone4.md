# Reflection

The map plot is automatically changed based on the selected country, therefore, when the client changes the continent selection, it will also modify the country selection, making it complicated to implement [zoom to continent](https://github.ubc.ca/fdandrea/532-peer-review/issues/15#issuecomment-23035) visualization.

The feedback on our front-end design from [classmates](https://github.ubc.ca/fdandrea/532-peer-review/issues/15#issuecomment-22995) and faculty members is very useful for us to improve our application layout. We implemented the multi-tab design such that the client does not need to scroll up and down to view the dashboard changes, it provides a convenient and cleaner user interface.
