# Reflection

## Things that we have implemented

1. Map plot with every single data point representing a country. The point color is adjusted by the continent and country filters.

## Things that are not implemented yet in our dashboard

1. Since there is limited space in a single webpage, we didn't want the customer to scroll up and down a lot, therefore, the small table output in the lower left corner of the sketch is not implemented yet.

## Things that are not working in our dashboard

1. When the customer filters the data by continent, the map plot will focus on the same selected country view instead of zooming out and showing the appearing/disappearing countries of the filtered continent(s). This feature is not available yet as the leaflet map is an observed element on the whole dashboard and it will refresh each time when there is an update.

## Limitations and Improvements

There are several limitations we can work on and further improve our dashboard in the future.

1. Currently our map plot only provides visualization on a single index, we can further add other types
of the index and provide more flexibility to the customer.
